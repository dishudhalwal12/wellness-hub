## 2. App Description & Current Workflow

**Wellness Hub** is an intelligent, all-in-one platform for medical clinics that integrates a powerful **AI Diagnostic Copilot** and an **AI Reception Assistant** directly into your workflow. The application is designed for role-based access, catering to Doctors, Admins, and Staff.

### a. User Onboarding & Authentication
The journey begins at the login screen, which serves a dual purpose: authentication for existing users and registration for new ones.
*   **Sign-Up:** New users can create an account via email/password or Google Sign-In. They have three onboarding paths:
    1.  **Create a Private Clinic:** Automatically assigns the user a "Doctor" role and creates a new clinic organization.
    2.  **Create a Hospital:** Assigns the user an "Admin" role and creates a new hospital organization.
    3.  **Join with Invite Code:** Allows a new user to join an existing organization. Their role ('doctor' or 'staff') is determined by the invite code.
*   **Login:** Existing users can sign in with their credentials. The system automatically recognizes their role and directs them to the appropriate starting page.

### b. Role-Based Dashboards & Navigation
Once logged in, the user experience is tailored to their role.
*   **Doctor View:** Doctors have access to the full suite of clinical tools, including the main dashboard, smart notes, patient management, billing, telehealth, AI reception, and practice insights.
*   **Admin View:** Admins are directed to the Admin Panel to manage the organization, create invite codes for new staff/doctors, and view high-level practice reports.
*   **Staff View:** Staff members have a focused view, primarily seeing their assigned tasks on a personal task board.

### c. Core Clinical & Administrative Features

**1. Main Dashboard (Doctor's Homepage)**
This is the command center, providing a real-time snapshot of the clinic's health.
*   **Key Metrics:** Displays live-calculated `Total Revenue`, `Patients Seen`, and `Average Consultation Fee` based on patient records in Firestore.
*   **Revenue Overview:** A bar chart visualizes monthly revenue trends.

**2. Patient Management**
A centralized hub for all patient information.
*   **Patient List:** View all patients in the organization with their status and last visit details.
*   **Add New Patient:** A dialog allows for quick registration of new patients. You can select a visit type:
    *   **OPD:** Sets a fixed consultation fee of ₹500.
    *   **Emergency:** Allows for a custom, user-inputted fee.
*   These fees are immediately reflected in the dashboard's financial metrics upon saving.

**3. AI Diagnostic Copilot (Patient Profile Page)**
This is the application's crown jewel.
*   **Upload & Analyze:** Upload a patient's health report (currently parses `.txt` files).
*   **AI Diagnosis:** Trigger an AI analysis that provides a detailed breakdown:
    *   **AI Summary & Key Abnormalities:** Highlights critical findings.
    *   **Potential & Differential Diagnoses:** Lists possibilities with confidence scores and reasoning.
    *   **Pathophysiology & Follow-ups:** Offers deep insights and actionable next steps.
*   **Interactive AI Chat:** Ask follow-up questions about the report. The AI maintains the context of the diagnosis.
*   **AI Prescription Generator:** Based on the final diagnosis, generate a comprehensive, print-ready prescription and management plan.

**4. AI Reception Assistant & Task Management**
A conversational AI to streamline front-desk and internal operations.
*   **Live Patient Queue:** The page displays a live queue of patients, pulled from the Firestore `patients` collection.
*   **Conversational Task Management:** Doctors can chat with the assistant to manage clinic tasks. For example:
    *   *"Create a task to call Mrs. Smith about her results, assign it to Alice, due tomorrow."*
    *   *"What are the pending tasks for today?"*
    *   *"Mark the task 'Review intake forms' as completed."*
*   The AI uses Genkit Tools (`createTask`, `updateTaskStatus`, `findTasks`) to interact directly with the `tasks` collection in your database, making changes in real-time.

**5. Task & Care Plan Manager (Kanban Board)**
A visual, interactive board for managing all clinic tasks.
*   **Drag-and-Drop Interface:** Tasks are displayed in columns: 'To Do', 'In Progress', and 'Completed'. Dragging a task card from one column to another automatically updates its status in the database.
*   **Create & Edit Tasks:** Add new tasks directly from the board or edit existing ones through a dialog.

**6. Other Integrated Features**
*   **Smart Notes:** A dedicated page for drafting clinical SOAP notes with an AI assistant panel to provide suggestions.
*   **AI Billing & Coding:** Paste visit notes to get AI-suggested ICD/CPT codes with confidence scores.
*   **Telehealth:** A page to start and manage secure, one-click video consultations using an integrated Jitsi-based service.
*   **AI Practice Insights:** Generate daily or weekly reports on patient trends, revenue sources, and marketing performance.
*   **Admin & Settings:** Manage organization details, invite codes, and configure your Google AI API key.
